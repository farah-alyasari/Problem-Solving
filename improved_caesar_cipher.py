'''
Problem statement:
The original Caesar cipher shifts each character by one: a becomes b, z becomes a, and so on. Let's make it a bit harder, and allow the shifted value to come from the range 1..25 inclusive.

Moreover, let the code preserve the letters' case (lower-case letters will remain lower-case) and all non-alphabetical characters should remain untouched.

Your task is to write a program which:

    asks the user for one line of text to encrypt;
    asks the user for a shift value (an integer number from the range 1..25 - note: you should force the user to enter a valid shift value (don't give up and don't let bad data fool you!)
    prints out the encoded text.
